## Initial Brainstorming


1. Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator
- We could have the players input their own items and spells that can be referred to and inputted in that can be accessed by them later. They can also put a picture from their camera roll, or take one to show at the top of the screen. Have the app have a set of modes to roll base stats from (could do the roll 4 remove lowest one or the point buy system) Gmail based login.

2. Shopping List Maker
- Allows users to create a drag and drop card of their to-do list and display completion. Location tracker to get current location, Api to determine local grocery shops that have delivery to compare item prices. Task List would then summarize lowest cost and then give to viewer

3. Finacial Helper
- Allows users to list and categorize expenses to view their spending habits and help discover unnecessary expenditures. Can connect to bank 

4. Augmented Reality Room Designer
- Allows users to use the phone camera to design their room. Can be connected to a amazon api or a a shop's api to get dimensions and then place it in the world through the user's app.

5. Quick Tip Calculator
- Allows users to quickly calculate a tip for a bill on the go. Yelp api to showcase local dinners according to the budget that the user can set. So as to track food costs on a budget to budget basis

6. Camera To PDF Converter
- Allows users to take a picture with the phone camera and convert it directly to a PDF.

7. Travel Optimizer
- Utilizing location services, calculates more optimal routes for the stops a user makes on a weekly basis. Can save routes and key locations to map to when offline.

8. Notes organizer
- Allows user to create notes and categorize them based upon folders, also allows for exporting to various different document types

9. Minecraft House Guide
- Lets people share houses they have built and categorize them to look at similar houses and draw inspiration.

10. Water Tracker
- Most people struggle to drink enough water a day. This app will display push notifications and reminders to the user to drink water throughout the day. Also allows them to track how much water they consume on average and if they should drink more.

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator
       
    **Description:**  We could have the players input their own items and spells that can be referred to and inputted in that can be accessed by them later. They can also put a picture from their camera roll, or take one to show at the top of the screen. Have the app have a set of modes to roll base stats from (could do the roll 4 remove lowest one or the point buy system) Gmail based login.
    
    **Category:** Entertainment/Social
    
    **Mobile:** Our App is uniquely mobile because of the fact that it is easy to open and with their mobile device, they can stay on the app and keep playing instead of having to tab into their character sheet. More will be added later, but for now, we are planning this app to have camera support to set the picture of the character that you are going to use, and we are going to have people be able to log in and see what characters they have created. There is also a dice roller that users will be able to use and put modifiers on.

    **Story:** Allows more fluid roleplay in dnd, by letting players conveniently access their character sheets. It will also let players learn more about what spells to use and how to level up properly. 

    **Market:**  This can be used by all people who want to learn how to play dnd, as this market is on the rise with DND gaining interest through a movie, as well as many podcasts, this app can help let the newer player base keep track of their characters easier, as well as learn how to play.

    **Habit:**  A user would most likely open this app about once a week, as dnd campaigns are usually held at a schedule of once a week. The app will be opened whenever the user wants to play dnd. Users will use our apps to create their characters and to actively change their stats, spells, items, etc.

    **Scope:**  Some of the most important parts of this program are going to be accessing the spell database and making a easy to use UI such that anyone can have the ability to create their character easily. A stripped down version of this project would still be interesting to build because it would just entail having the user input their own spells, items, etc. instead of guiding them through it as planned.
       
2. Shopping List Maker

    **Description:** Allows users to create a drag and drop card of their to do list and display completion. Location tracker to get current location, Api to determine local grocery shops that have delivery/pickup to compare item prices. Task List would then summarize lowest cost and then give to viewer. Task List can then use the items in the list to later recommend more items of the same nature.

    **Category:** Shopping app
    
    **Mobile:** Allows shoppers to keep in track of their financial budgets while ordering groceries. Shoppers are given control to adjust their list based on the prices from various local stores. With Mobile it makes the process of rechecking their list and buying groceries more convenient. Location is used to localize decisions along with a database to store and recommend stores that have been previously visited or are of high rating based upon the shopper's previous decisions.
    
    **Story:** Creates a healthy environment where shoppers can attain their desired lifestyle at a reasonably cost effective budget. Allows to easy access to more local stores that could sell the products they desire in a cheaper manner than having it delivered daily.
    
    **Market:** Anyone who desires to buy groceries and various everyday amenities can utilize this app. Is targeted towards the more budget conscious shoppers that is seeing a growth in the market population
    
    **Habit:** Buying groceries is tied to this app as such the user will be utilizing this app nearly daily depending on the user's expenditure.
    
    **Scope:** V1 would allow for saving of the list to a local database that can be accessed offline. V2 would allow for integration of an API that would take in this list and give back a list of stores that have the requested items in stock. V3 would see that the location feature is used to localize the list of stores with the available listed items, this localization distance can be changed by the user. For V4 the app will utilize the stored items and the interacted stores to recommend items that are bought more frequently and items of the categories from the saved list.
       
2. Minecraft House Guide

    **Description:** The Minecraft House Guide would be an app where you can view and study user submitted designs and guides for Minecraft houses or Minecraft builds, and submit them yourself

    **Category:** Entertainment/Social

    **Mobile:** Our app wouldn't be too good for mobile. The biggest feature, sharing designs, would be more suited for a custom file type or actual Minecraft world files, which phones can be finicky with. The best I could manage is that a camera could be used for sharing build previews.

    **Story:** The app would be very compelling exclusively to the people who would need it most. Most people aren't interested in furthering their building skills, so it would just be for the specific market.

    **Market:** The market for this app would naturally be the playerbase of Minecraft, who are willing to delve deeper into building techniques and guides. The app would provide a large benefit to those within the niche. Since content would be user created, it would apply to newcomers to the craft and veterans alike.

    **Habit:** People would use this app only as habitual as they make buildings within Minecraft. A user could open the app up and study while away from Minecraft, but that could be a bonus rather than a main feature. A user will only open it as often as they are building, and since building in Minecraft is a skill that needs to be practiced, this can be quite frequent.

    **Scope:** The biggest hurdle in the scope of this app would be finding a way to transfer the data of a build from user to user. While a recipie sharing app wouldn't be too difficult, the app probably wouldn't be compelling without some way to preview a build before making it. Images or videos or gifs would serve as substitutes, but wouldn't be too compelling otherwise

**FINAL IDEA:** After talking it over, we decided to do the dungeons and dragons application because we believe it will a useful tool for dungeons and dragons campaigns everywhere, and with dnd getting a movie recently, the userbase will be ever-growing for this app. We also have a lot of personal investment in this app and believe we can adequately give dnd players with a useful tool to use in future campaigns.
